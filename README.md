# Speech_emotion_recognition

Hello connections, I'm excited to share my project named Speech Emotion Recognition 🎙️

✨ Here's the project flow:

🎧 Noise Injection:
🔸Introducing random noise to make the model robust against input signal noise.

⌛ Time Shifting: 
🔸Shuffling audio in time to handle temporal shifts gracefully.

🕰️ Time Stretching:
🔸Compressing time for adaptability.

🔊 Volume Scaling:
🔸Adjusting volume to handle varying input loudness.

📊 Data Splitting:

Dividing the dataset
🔸Training Set: 70%
🔸Testing Set: 30%
🔸Validation Set: 5% of the Training Set.

🔍 Features Extraction with librosa:

🔸Using the powerful librosa library and extracting key features from audio files:
🔹Zero Crossing Rate
🔹 Energy
🔹 Mel Spectrogram

🔄 Data Augmentation: Noise, time shift, pitch shift, time stretch, volume scale.

🎤 Ready for the Emotional Wave. Stay tuned for the sound of success! 🚀🔊
